Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.
Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1
def binary_array_to_number(arr):
    number = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)): #Suppose len of arr is 9, then, for a number in range 0 to 9
        number += arr[i]*2**(len(arr)-1-i) #Borrows from conversion to binary formula
    return number #number required was set outside the for loop
